I don't do anything too special, I mainly write Javascript, but have dabbled in Ruby, Scala, and plenty of AltJS languages like: CoffeeScript, LiveScript, and PureScript.
I primarily write Object Oriented code, while attempting to bring more and more Functional Programming into the mix. I am actually currently
studying Functional Programming, as well as Reactive Programming, and at some point Functional Reactive Programming.</p><p>I work at this place called <a href'//originate.com'>Originate</a> as a Javascript Developer, but I occasionally get
my hands dirty with markup and CSS. I've recently have been working with a lot of React + Flux code which in turn has me researching
native web components and such. I also work on some Node projects occasionally, but nothing to fancy. I mainly enjoy understanding the
working internals of the Javascript Runtime and Node's Asynchronous model. I'm also enjoy writing powerful abstrations with
features from ES5, ES6, and eventually ES7.</p><p>I enjoy public speaking and giving presentations on anything I care about or anything that could help someone learn.
I have several strong opinions on software architecture and code clarity, as well as a strong belief in isolated testing.
I try to write about a lot of these things in several blogs, some aimed for more technical discussions, others aimed more to philosophy.
I hope to grow into a positive influence in programming community and to keep learning without becoming an elitist.
You can find me on <a href="//twitter.com/seanghagstrom">Twitter</a> and <a href="//github.com/seanstrom">Github</a> for the most part, but I also post some writing to <a href="//seanstrom.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>, <a href="//medium.com/@seanghagstrom">Medium</a>, and <a href="seanhagstrom.svbtle.com">Svbtle</a>.
